# Reports and Implementation Documentation

This directory contains reports, case studies, implementation guides, and technical documentation for the Sociobiodiversity Data Standard project.

## Project Reports

- **[PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)** - Complete context of the GBIF/CESP 2024-015 project
- **[CASE_STUDIES_OVERVIEW.md](CASE_STUDIES_OVERVIEW.md)** - Overview of the three validation case studies

## Case Study Documentation

The project validated the Darwin Core extension through three comprehensive case studies:

### Case Study 1: Medicinal Plants in South American Communities
- Focus: Traditional medicinal knowledge
- Regions: Brazil (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado), Colombia (Amazon, Andes), Argentina (Yungas, Pampas)
- Key aspects: Medicinal uses, preparation methods, knowledge attribution
- **Status**: Completed

### Case Study 2: Agroecological and Food Uses
- Focus: Traditional agricultural practices and food uses
- Regions: Multiple agricultural zones across partner countries
- Key aspects: Crop varieties, wild food plants, agroforestry systems, food preparation
- **Status**: Completed

### Case Study 3: Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Biodiversity Monitoring
- Focus: Integration of traditional knowledge with community-based monitoring
- Regions: Indigenous territories and protected areas
- Key aspects: Species identification, ecological knowledge, conservation practices
- **Status**: Completed

## Implementation Guides

The following implementation guides are planned:

- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - How to implement the extension in your system
- **DATA_MAPPING_GUIDE.md** - How to map existing data to extension terms
- **COMMUNITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - How communities can use the extension

## Feature Reports

Feature Reports will document:

- Community input and feedback
- Use case analysis and examples
- Implementation experiences
- Best practices and recommendations
- Lessons learned from validation

**Status**: In development (expected early 2025)
