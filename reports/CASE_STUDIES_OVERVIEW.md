# Case Studies for Socio-Biodiversity Extension Validation

## Overview

The Socio-Biodiversity Task Group validated the Darwin Core extension through three complementary case studies conducted during the GBIF/CESP 2024-015 project. These case studies tested the extension's applicability across different regions and knowledge systems.

## Case Study 1: Medicinal Plants in South American Communities

### Objective

Document and standardize traditional medicinal knowledge associated with plant species used by indigenous and local communities in Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina.

### Geographic Scope

- **Brazil**: Atlantic Forest and Cerrado regions
- **Colombia**: Amazon and Andean regions
- **Argentina**: Yungas forest and Pampas regions

### Key Focus Areas

- Traditional medicinal plant uses
- Indigenous and peasant knowledge systems
- Preparation methods and dosages
- Associated ecological knowledge
- Benefit-sharing and community protocols

### Species Documented

- Ethnobotanically significant plants
- Multiple vernacular names across regions and languages
- Associated traditional uses
- Knowledge holder attribution

### Methodologies

- Community consultations and workshops
- Literature review of ethnobotanical research
- Interviews with traditional healers and knowledge holders
- Ecological surveys in traditional territories

### Key Findings

- **Multilingual Documentation**: Importance of recording vernacular names in multiple languages
- **Knowledge Attribution**: Need for clear mechanisms to credit communities and knowledge holders
- **Consent Protocols**: Essential to obtain FPIC before documenting sensitive knowledge
- **Use Complexity**: Single species often has multiple uses across different contexts and communities
- **Documentation Gaps**: Limited standardized information about preparation methods and dosages

### Implementation Insights

1. **Data Collection Requirements**:
   - Detailed use descriptions with preparation methods
   - Information about knowledge holders and communities
   - Geographic and ecological context
   - Temporal information (seasonality, traditional calendars)

2. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Some knowledge requires community permission for public sharing
   - Sacred plants and uses may have restricted access
   - Economic implications for indigenous pharmacology

3. **Extension Validation**:
   - Terms and definitions validated through community feedback
   - Vocabulary requirements for use categories and preparation methods
   - Need for community protocol documentation

### Output Files

- `case_study_1_medicinal_plants.csv`: Documented medicinal plant uses
- `case_study_1_metadata.json`: Associated metadata and provenance information
- `case_study_1_community_protocols.txt`: Community protocols and agreements

- Wild food plant collection and use
- Traditional agricultural practices and ecological management
- Seed saving and plant breeding traditions
- Food preparation and culinary practices
- Nutritional knowledge

### Species Documented

- Cultivated crop varieties
- Wild food plants
- Associated species in agroforestry systems
- Crop wild relatives

### Methodologies

- Farmer and community interviews
- Participatory resource mapping
- Agricultural field surveys
- Documentation of traditional practices
- Analysis of seed diversity

### Key Findings

- **Agrobiodiversity**: High diversity of local crop varieties adapted to regional conditions
- **Knowledge Integration**: Traditional agriculture combines ecological, nutritional, and cultural knowledge
- **Use Patterns**: Multiple uses of single species (food, medicinal, craft, ecological service)
- **Climate Adaptation**: Traditional practices contain valuable climate adaptation strategies
- **Seed Sovereignty**: Importance of documenting seed saving and exchange practices

### Implementation Insights

1. **Data Collection Requirements**:
   - Agroecological context and land management practices
   - Crop variety characteristics and performance
   - Traditional ecological calendars and timing
   - Knowledge about plant-ecosystem interactions

2. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Farmer rights to plant varieties and traditional knowledge
   - Community control over agricultural data
   - Economic implications for agricultural systems

3. **Extension Validation**:
   - Need for agricultural use category extensions
   - Validation of ecological and seasonal information
   - Community authority in data sharing

### Output Files

- `case_study_2_food_uses.csv`: Documented food and crop uses
- `case_study_2_agroecological_practices.md`: Traditional agricultural practices
- `case_study_2_community_feedback.txt`: Community input and validation

## Case Study 3: Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Biodiversity Monitoring

### Objective

Integrate traditional ecological knowledge with community-based biodiversity monitoring initiatives, supporting both conservation and cultural knowledge preservation.

### Geographic Scope

- Indigenous territories and traditional lands
- Protected areas with community participation
- Regions with active community monitoring programs

### Key Focus Areas

- Species identification and local classification systems
- Ecological knowledge and species interactions
- Population monitoring and trend documentation
- Traditional conservation practices
- Habitat management and restoration

### Species Documented

- Culturally significant species
- Species important for food security
- Sacred or spiritually significant species
- Species of conservation concern

### Methodologies

- Community biodiversity monitoring programs
- Integration with scientific monitoring
- Documentation of local classification systems
- Interviews with experienced community members
- Participatory species identification

### Key Findings

- **Classification Systems**: Communities have sophisticated species identification and categorization systems
- **Ecological Knowledge**: Deep understanding of species interactions and ecosystem dynamics
- **Conservation Practice**: Traditional management practices enhance conservation outcomes
- **Knowledge Application**: Local knowledge guides sustainable use decisions
- **Monitoring Capacity**: Communities able to conduct systematic species monitoring

### Implementation Insights

1. **Data Collection Requirements**:
   - Local species names and classification systems
   - Ecological knowledge and species interactions
   - Population status and trend information
   - Management practices and conservation history

2. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Community intellectual property rights
   - Sacred species and restricted knowledge
   - Data sovereignty and community control

3. **Extension Validation**:
   - Support for vernacular species naming systems
   - Documentation of ecological knowledge
   - Integration with formal biodiversity monitoring data

### Output Files

- `case_study_3_species_monitoring.csv`: Community biodiversity monitoring data
- `case_study_3_ecological_knowledge.md`: Traditional ecological knowledge documentation

## Cross-Case Insights

### Common Themes

1. **Attribution and Recognition**: Critical importance of proper credit to knowledge holders
2. **Multiple Uses**: Species typically have multiple uses across different contexts
3. **Cultural Context**: Understanding use requires knowledge of cultural and ecological context
4. **Vernacular Diversity**: Multiple names for species across languages and regions
5. **Consent Requirements**: Community permissions essential for all knowledge documentation

### Vocabulary Requirements

The case studies identified need for standardized vocabularies including:

- **Use Categories**: Standardized types of species uses
- **Preparation Methods**: How resources are processed and prepared
- **Cultural Practices**: Types of traditional practices
- **Ecological Features**: Environmental characteristics related to use
- **Community Types**: Classifications of communities and knowledge holders

### Data Quality Lessons

1. **Completeness**: Importance of documenting full context
2. **Accuracy**: Verification through community consultation
3. **Currency**: Regular updates and version management
4. **Traceability**: Clear documentation of information sources

### Community Engagement Outcomes

1. **Participation**: Successful participation when processes respect community protocols
2. **Ownership**: Communities more engaged when they control data use
3. **Benefit**: Clear benefit-sharing increases participation and trust
4. **Authority**: Communities should have decision-making authority

   - Allow adaptation to regional and cultural contexts
   - Support multiple language and classification systems
   - Accommodate diverse use types and practices

3. **Interoperability**
   - Maintain compatibility with Darwin Core
   - Align with international standards and frameworks
   - Support integration with existing systems

4. **Protection**
