# Project Context: GBIF/CESP 2024-015

## Project Title

**Developing a Data Extension for Documenting Socio-Biodiversity Information**

## Project Identification

- **GBIF Project Number**: CESP2024-015
- **Duration**: December 2024 – March 2026
- **Funding Organization**: GBIF Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP)
- **Lead Organization**: SIBBR (Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira)
- **Partner Countries**: Brazil, Colombia, Argentina
- **Regional Networks**: SiBBr (Brazil), SiB Colombia, GBIF Argentina

## Project Vision

To create a standardized framework for documenting sociobiodiversity—integrating species scientific and vernacular names with traditional knowledge about biodiversity uses—ensuring ethical handling, legal compliance, proper attribution, and long-term preservation of cultural heritage.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Fragmentation of Knowledge**
   - Traditional knowledge often separate from biodiversity databases
   - Inconsistent documentation across regions and organizations
   - Limited interoperability between information systems

2. **Attribution and Recognition Issues**
   - Traditional knowledge often used without proper acknowledgment
   - Communities not credited for knowledge contributions
   - Disconnect between data users and knowledge holders

3. **Legal and Ethical Gaps**
   - Limited compliance with international frameworks (Nagoya Protocol, CBD)
   - Inadequate protection of intellectual property rights
   - Insufficient implementation of FPIC (Free, Prior, and Informed Consent)
   - Inadequate benefit-sharing mechanisms

4. **Data Quality and Standardization**
   - Inconsistent terminology and definitions
   - Limited documentation of data sources and provenance
   - Variable levels of data completeness and reliability

5. **Knowledge Preservation**
   - Risk of traditional knowledge loss as communities change
   - Limited documentation mechanisms for oral traditions
   - Inadequate integration into formal information systems

## Project Objectives

   - Validate across different regions and knowledge systems
   - Ensure robustness and applicability

4. **Capacity Building**
   - Build regional capacity for socio-biodiversity data management
   - Train implementers and data managers
   - Establish knowledge networks across partner countries

5. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Link traditional knowledge with biodiversity information systems
