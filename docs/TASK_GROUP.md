## Motivation

There is an increasing need to aggregate data from community-based monitoring initiatives, which often involve traditional knowledge held by local, peasant, Afro-descendant, Indigenous, and other communities. This data is frequently connected to the ways in which these communities relate to biodiversity.

**Key Challenges Addressed:**

- Traditional knowledge information is often used without proper acknowledgment or linking to original sources
- Lack of standardization in documenting biodiversity use practices and benefits
- Need for ethical frameworks ensuring appropriate attribution and traceability
- Importance of integrating community-based datasets into national information systems
- Preservation of traditional knowledge for future generations

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goal

Develop an extension for the Darwin Core standard to represent socio-biodiversity data—especially species information linked to traditional knowledge regarding biodiversity use practices and benefits—in ways that ensure:

- **Ethical handling** of sensitive cultural information
- **Legal compliance** with international frameworks (Nagoya Protocol, CARE Principles)
- **Traceability** of information sources
- **Interoperability** with existing biodiversity standards
- **Knowledge preservation** for future generations

### Key Objectives

1. Provide a community-driven framework ensuring biodiversity use and benefits information is properly documented, recognized, attributed, and preserved
2. Develop a standardized Darwin Core extension for documenting biodiversity uses, benefits, and associated traditional knowledge
3. Define appropriate classes, terms, definitions, and vocabularies for consistent, ethical, interoperable representation
4. Support accurate attribution of traditional knowledge holders
5. Promote data practices aligned with ethical and legal standards
6. Validate the extension using multiple datasets and diverse data sources

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Darwin Core Extension**
   - A vocabulary compliant with TDWG's Vocabulary Maintenance Specification
   - Standard terms and definitions for socio-biodiversity concepts

2. **Feature Report**
   - Summarizing community input and use cases
   - Implementation guidance and best practices

3. **Supporting Documentation**
   - Human-readable term lists
   - Case studies and examples
   - Integration guides

4. **Public Records**
   - Meeting notes, discussions, and decisions
   - Transparent collaboration history

## Scope and Limitations

### Within Scope

- Documentation of species uses and benefits
- Integration of traditional knowledge with biodiversity data
- Attribution and recognition of knowledge holders
- Ethical frameworks for data handling
- Alignment with Darwin Core standard

### Out of Scope (Future Considerations)

- Specific products or transformation processes involving biodiversity resources
- License types, authorizations, or governance-related metadata
- (These may be revisited as part of broader discussions)

## Historical Context

The Socio-Biodiversity Task Group builds on work initiated by the **GBIF/CESP 2024-015 project**: *"Developing a Data Extension for Documenting Socio-Biodiversity Information"*

### CESP Project Achievements

- Brought together experts from Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina
- Conducted workshops, online meetings, and community consultations
- Designed and refined Darwin Core extension through collaborative process
- Developed three case studies for initial validation (primarily ethnobotany-focused)
- Created clear vocabularies and consistent definitions
- Established framework adaptable to animals and microorganisms

### Formalization

The establishment of this Task Group formalizes ongoing efforts within TDWG, providing:
- Structured framework for open participation
- Broader community input mechanisms
- Path to eventual recognition and adoption as TDWG standard

## Communication Strategy

### Primary Channels

- **Mailing List**: Subscribe for updates and discussions
- **GitHub Issues**: Dedicated discussions for each term
- **GitHub Repository**: Central repository at https://github.com/sibbr/cesp-sibbr-2024/

### Collaboration Approach

- All records stored publicly in GitHub for transparency
- Dedicated GitHub issue for each term under discussion
- Documentation of all progress, searchable and publicly accessible
- Open participation from interested experts and community members

## How to Participate

### Who Should Get Involved

- **Data Holders**: Communities, local groups, and researchers managing socio-biodiversity information
- **Data Users**: Biodiversity informaticians needing standardized descriptions
